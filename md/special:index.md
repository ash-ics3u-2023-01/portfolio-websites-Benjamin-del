Welcome to the Home Page of my Site!!!

This is my Portfolio for ASH ICS3U @ ASH!

## About Me

Hello! I am Ben M!

I have built applications like this, and so many more! I enjoy working with Open Source Software!

## My Projects

I have built many projects. My Favorite one is Benja-Transit. 
### Benja Transit3 & TransitDB3
This Project uses GTFS to Create a very nice schedule and realtime tracker! Currently in Beta, The Full version will be ready soon!

[Live Preview](https://next-transit.vercel.app/)

This project also uses TransitDB3 to store the GTFS data. To fit within reasonable file limits, I have condensed all of the files to a custom condensed version of GTFS! I am currently working on adding more transit agencies to the app and ensuring the API works well! 

[Transit DB3 Github Repo](https://github.com/Benjamin-del/TransitDB3)
Both of these projects use Gitub Actions to automaticly update the Data! I have learn't so much about these in the past few months that I have worked on! (TransitDB3 runs every Sunday, while this one only runs when something has been pushed)

If you understand the Syntax for Github Actions, Feel Free to check out the Workflow file [here](/.github/workflows/page.yml)
### Benja SSG

This site runs on a hacked version of Benja-SSG. I have built this project for this class and I have used it for my sites!

There is no GH Repo for this project yet! Stay Tuned!
## About this Site!
This site was built with Marked & My own Javascript to create a SSG using Markdown Files! You may see HTML but this was generated from a MD File! All of the Generated files are available on Github using the links at the bottom of this page! I did take inspiration from MediaWiki on their use of the `special:` pages (this page is a "special" page), but I am using a different language from them!!
