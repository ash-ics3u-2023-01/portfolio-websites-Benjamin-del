      <h1>HOME</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Home Page of my Site!!!</p>
      <p>This is my Portfolio for ASH ICS3U @ ASH!</p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I am Ben M!</p>
      <p>I have built applications like this, and so many more! I enjoy working with Open Source Software!</p>
      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      <p>I have built many projects. My Favorite one is Benja-Transit. </p>
      <h3>Benja Transit3 &amp; TransitDB3</h3>
      <p>This Project uses GTFS to Create a very nice schedule and realtime tracker! Currently in Beta, The Full version will be ready soon!</p>
      <p><a href="https://next-transit.vercel.app/">Live Preview</a></p>
      <p>This project also uses TransitDB3 to store the GTFS data. To fit within reasonable file limits, I have condensed all of the files to a custom condensed version of GTFS! I am currently working on adding more transit agencies to the app and ensuring the API works well! </p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-del/TransitDB3">Transit DB3 Github Repo</a>
        Both of these projects use Gitub Actions to automaticly update the Data! I have learn't so much about these in the past few months that I have worked on! (TransitDB3 runs every Sunday, while this one only runs when something has been pushed)</p>
      <p>If you understand the Syntax for Github Actions, Feel Free to check out the Workflow file <a href="/.github/workflows/page.yml">here</a></p>
      <h3>Benja SSG</h3>
      <p>This site runs on a hacked version of Benja-SSG. I have built this project for this class and I have used it for my sites!</p>
      <p>There is no GH Repo for this project yet! Stay Tuned!</p>
      <h2>About this Site!</h2>
      <p>This site was built with Marked &amp; My own Javascript to create a SSG using Markdown Files! You may see HTML but this was generated from a MD File! All of the Generated files are available on Github using the links at the bottom of this page! I did take inspiration from MediaWiki on their use of the <code>special:</code> pages (this page is a "special" page), but I am using a different language from them!!</p>
